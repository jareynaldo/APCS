(+)I was able to successfully write and read data onto a document. I had a fun time learning 
all of these things on the spot as i didn't have much knowledge of them prior. I apreciated
how many different things we've covered previously (like ASCII) showed up in this project.


(-) I had a couple of challenges in the creation of this project. One of the biggest i had 
early on was that my passwords didn't come out truly random. What seemeed to be happening 
was that i initiated the password variable at the very top and didn't clear the value
when i went to add another password to the list. I was able to fix this while also realizing 
that the password characters had stricter than anticipated guidelines, causing me to rethink 
my entire password making process. 

+ Overall i would say i truly enjoyed this project. It seemed to me as the most complex
project when in the planning stages as a lot of things were happening at the same time. But 
i was able to look through it all and make a program that runs and that i'm proud of.
