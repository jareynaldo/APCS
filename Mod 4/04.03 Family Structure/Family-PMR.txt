(+)I was able to successfully scan a document to process the data inside of it with a 
simple program.  I had a fun time launching myself into unexplored territory by taking 
on this project and I am very happy with the way it turned out technically and 
aesthetically. 


(-) The biggest challenge in this program was an error on my part in the text editor. 
Even though I have experience linking multiple files together and am used to the 
standard directory paths, I hadn't realized I was in the mod 4 assignments folders 
instead of the 04.03 folder. Which lead to 40 minutes of problem-solving to get my 
code to read the file until I realized my mistake and switched to the correct directory. 

+ This project helped me understand and comprehend how java reads files and interacts 
with them. I found it very interesting the different loops you have to jump through like 
having different types of tokens for different types of data to manipulate it. It looks 
like a very fun challenge and I look forward to continue to experiment in this domain.
