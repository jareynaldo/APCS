<+> i had a fun time implimenting some physics consepts 
into cs in a program. This has now peaked my curiosity on 
how  calculation and higher level mathematic programs opperate.
Overall i enjoyed the project and understood it well. 

<-> I didn't have any particularly difficult portions. 
Since everything was already layed out for me just some 
simple implimentation.

+ although i woudn't say i learned anything through this 
project i definertly did sherpen my skills in methods and 
upped a level of complexety in my programs where the main 
method is no longer carrying the brunt of the tasks.
