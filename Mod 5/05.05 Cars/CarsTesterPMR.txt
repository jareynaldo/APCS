<+> I enjoyed doing something like messing around with cars 
in a program for the first time. I really enjoyed the new 
complexety of the program and the new things this allows me 
to do. 

<-> the only thing i really had a problem with was setting 
primative value types for variables but once i got that figured 
out i had an easy time with the rest of it. 

+ I learned a lot through this project. I have enjoyed learning 
amout OOP a lot and being able to imploment it has been tremendous.
