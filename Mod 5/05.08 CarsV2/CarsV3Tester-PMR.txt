<+> I enjoyed building actual objects with indivudual properties
that i could set and manipulate rather than just use the methods 
to do reperative taks. Like this i was able to save a lot of space 
and time in the front end even if it does mean writting a little bit 
more code on the back end. 

<-> I had a difficult time knowing what exactly i needed to add for 
the CarsV2 constructors. I'm not sure if I need to acciunt for every 
possible combination or just the ones that are most likely. I did the 
ladder since I figured the DNRY principle kicks in. 

+ Overall I learned a lot. This includes further practice with classes
and objects, setting constructors, allowing for overloaded methods, and
setting perameters with constructors.
