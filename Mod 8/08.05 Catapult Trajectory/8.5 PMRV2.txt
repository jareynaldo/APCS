+ I was reviwing some code and I realized that it was possible to create a 
objects within a class and then use that object later on in the main program.
This was much easier for me since I could break down a much larger task down to 
smaller methods, which I then implimented in the main method. 

- Although it did end up being easier, I still had a hard time figuring out the 
beggining steps when working with 2d arrays. It took a while to figure out but 
I'm glad that I was able to. 

(+) Although in the previus assigment I learned a bit about 2d arrays it wasn't 
until this assigment that I feel like I became more familiar with it. Messing
around and trying different things allowed me to get more familiar with this 
new concept.
