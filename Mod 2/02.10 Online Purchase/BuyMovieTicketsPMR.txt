(+) I was able to successfully implement a method to successfully check if
 the input values were valid and to print the receipt at the end of the bill.
 I like how they both turned out since it saved me a lot of time from having
 to redo checks and was able to practice an important skill of being a 
 software developer of DNRY. 

(-) The one thing I had a hard time doing was finding a more precise way to 
 check if the input value was actually valid. I believe if I would of put more
 time into it I could have found a solution but since this was already outside
 the main score of the project I decided to work on it in future projects. 


+ This project was very significant regarding my growth as a software developer.
 I was able to practice many key skills which I had previously not had the 
 opportunity to work with together. Working with Input values also added a brand
 new level of complexity which I really enjoyed. Especially working with the 
 possible errors really taught me how to maneuver around that and what to expect
 from user input.
