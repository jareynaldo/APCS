(+)I was able to sucsesfully use an if else if strucutre inside of a program. I 
had a fun time working with this slightly more complicated program as i was able 
to incorportate many different aspects into a single program. 

(-) The biggest challenge in this program was when i tried to shorten the double 
values that i had recived after i did my calculations. I tried several different 
methods which included converting into string and using "substring" but ended 
up deciding that simply implimenting the method i added was the simpelest solution.

+ This project taught me to include many different concepts together into one whole 
cohesive program. I was able to learn how to work with if else if statements in java
and sucsesfully implimented the challenge that was asked of me.
